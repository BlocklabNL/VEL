To gather as much data as possible and make onboarding easy and fun we should integrate with domotics projects.

###Costs

We should try to keep the costs of onboarding down and keep it as simple as possible.

Normal costs:

- Raspberry Pi 3B   ~40 euro
- Usb power supply  ~10 euro
- SD card           ~10 euro
- P1 cable          ~20 euro

Total: ~70 euro


We could try to reduce this costs by offering or let someone offer a cheaper cable that hooks up directly to the GPIO pins
Maybe we could even get the electricity to power Raspberry Pi from the P1 port.

Possible lower costs:

- Raspberry Pi zero W ~15 euro
- SD card             ~10 euro
- Custom cable        ~10 euro

Total: ~25 euro
