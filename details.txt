DEVICES
- Devices are currently being kept anonymous re: names but are including geolocation data
(need to check re: GDPR compliance etc) This could be updated easily in the future to include
names / more if needed.
- Geolocation data verification will be included at a later date via integrating something like FOAM's tech
( see https://f-o-a-m.github.io/foam.developer/ for more ).
- The python & javascript packages will be available as drivers to download onto your IoT
device of choice to start piping data to our BDB node.

WEB INTERFACE
- Including registration and login system for data use / parsing (will be useful for
later building of applications)
	+ add ability to register your device (need to work out proper way of doing this securely...publicKey?)
- show 'generic' infographic on front page of interface
- opportunity to parse data without logging in?
- use netlify to host instead of GitHub pages
